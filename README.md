# Switcher

### Build Guide

1. First gather all of the parts. You will need:
 - Particle Photon
 - Breadboard
 - 3D Printed Case
 - Micro Servo Motor
 - Double-sided Adhesive
 - 5V Power Supply
 - Micro USB Cable
 - Pin Headers
 - Solid Strand Wire

2. Print the case for the motor:
   Use 100% infill.
   You can use any material and any layer height.
   If you do not have a 3D printer you can order the part on Thingiverse
   
3. Grab the long arm that came with the servo and attach it.
4. Use the screws that came with the servo and attach the 3D printed case to it.
5. Use the double-sided adhesive to attach the servo next to the switch.
6. Next place the Particle Photon on the breadboard and stick it too the wall next to the servo.
7. Plug the servo into the breadboard using the pin headers.
8. Connect to red to the 5V pin on the Photon, connect the brown wire to GND, and connect
   the yellow wire to pin D0.
9. Plug the Photon in and you are all set. Next you need to flash the firmware.
